## Heading that shows up in the sidebar on the right
Some information

### Sub-part of that above heading
And you can continue like this with further \##s 

## Different strats at the same time
If May and Cody are doing different strats at the same time, you should use a combination of the \<Table>,\<May> and \<Cody> tags.

<Table> 
<May>
This let's you split up the strats neatly.
</May>
<Cody>
And you can see Cody is doing something different over here.
</Cody>
</Table>

If they're doing strats at the same time, leave it as is.

<May>
You can also just use the May or Cody tag if it doesn't make sense to use them both, but you still need to clearly show it's a strat for the specific character.
</May>


## Indicating difficulty

When there are multiple variations to a strat, we can use these to indicate the respective difficulty.

<Table>
:::easy
Use \:::easy to indicate an easy strat.
:::

:::medium
Use \:::medium to indicate a medium strat.
:::

:::hard You can also override the difficulty title
Use \:::hard to indicate a hard strat.
:::
</Table>

<Table>
<May>

:::easy
This can be used in combination with the \<May> and \<Cody> tags from before
:::

:::medium
A medium strat
:::

:::hard
A hard strat
:::

:::info
Some info
:::

</May>
<Cody>

:::easy
An easy strat
:::

:::medium
A medium strat for Cody
:::

:::hard
A hard strat for Cody
:::

</Cody>
</Table>

## Something

<Table>
