## Want to contribute?

This wiki runs on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to work.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install NodeJS (ideally v18.16 but v16 or above should work too i think)
3. Install all the necessary packages by running `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in your local repo
4. Then run `npm run docusaurus start` to run the site locally (it automatically updates whenever you save your changes)
5. Make your changes
6. Make a pull request

The docs themselves are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and all documentation text can be found in the `docs` directory
